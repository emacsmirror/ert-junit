# ert-junit - JUnit XML reports from ert results

ert-junit publishes ert test results as JUnit XML files.

[ert][ERTMANUAL] already provides a way to run tests in batch mode
from the command line.  The results are printed on stdout.  ert-junit
does the same, but also writes test result to a [JUnit][JUNIT]
compatible [XML-file][JUNITXSD].

ert-junit also provides various functions for use from general elisp code.

ert-junit was originally conceived to facilitate [CI][CI] testing on
http://shippable.com.

## ert-junit-run-tests-batch-and-exit (&optional selector)

Run all known [ert][ERTMANUAL] tests and exit emacs.  Corresponds to
[`ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit`][ert-b-and-e].  This function is only
meant to be used in Emacs batch mode.  The name of the output file is
read as the first available command line argument.  Exits Emacs with
exit status set to 0 if all test results were as expected, 1 on
unexpected results or 2 for non-test errors. The example below shows
how to use `ert-junit-run-tests-batch-and-exit` from the command line
to execute the tests defined in tests.el.
    
    $ emacs --batch -Q -L tests.el -L ert-junit.el \
        -f ert-junit-run-tests-batch-and-exit results.xml

## ert-junit-run-tests-batch (result-file &optional selector)

Run ert tests selected by `selector` and write the XML report to
`result-file`.  If `result-file` already exists it is overwritten.
Corresponds to - and indeed calls - `ert-run-tests-batch`.
