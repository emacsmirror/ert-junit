;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains support functions and macros that are useful
;; when testing other code that generate JUnit XML data.  It was
;; created to support testing of
;; https://bitbucket.org/olanilsson/ert-junit and
;; https://bitbucket.org/olanilsson/buttercup-junit .

;; esxml is the form that is returned by such functions as
;; libxml-parse-xml-region and is used internally by Emacs in many xml
;; related libraries.
